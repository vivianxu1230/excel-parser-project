# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is an accompaniment to the Medium article I wrote [linked here](https://vivianxu1230.medium.com/integrating-xlsx-file-uploading-with-a-react-apps-back-end-7a276a6c57ea) on how to integrate excel file uploading functionality into your React app's back-end.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm server`

Launches the express server running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). To complete the tutorial, both ports need to be running.
